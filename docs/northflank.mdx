title: Deploy on Northflank
---

Deploy OpenClaw on Northflank with a one-click template and finish setup in your browser.
This is the easiest “no terminal on the server” path: Northflank runs the Gateway for you,
and you configure everything via the `/setup` web wizard.

## How to get started

1. Click [Deploy OpenClaw](https://northflank.com/stacks/deploy-openclaw) to open the template.  
2. Create an [account on Northflank](https://app.northflank.com/signup) if you don’t already have one.  
3. Click **Deploy OpenClaw now**.  
4. Set the required environment variable: `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
5. Click **Deploy stack** to build and run the OpenClaw template.
6. Wait for the deployment to complete, then click **View resources**.
7. Open the OpenClaw service.
8. Open the public OpenClaw URL and complete setup at `/setup`.
9. Open the Control UI at `/openclaw`.

## What you get

- Hosted OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI
- Web setup wizard at `/setup` (no terminal commands)
- Persistent storage via Northflank Volume (`/data`) so config/credentials/workspace survive redeploys

## Setup flow

1) Visit `https://<your-northflank-domain>/setup` and enter your `SETUP_PASSWORD`.
2) Choose a model/auth provider and paste your key.
3) (Optional) Add Telegram/Discord/Slack tokens.
4) Click **Run setup**.
5) Open the Control UI at `https://<your-northflank-domain>/openclaw`

If Telegram DMs are set to pairing, the setup wizard can approve the pairing code.

## Getting chat tokens

### Telegram bot token

1) Message `@BotFather` in Telegram
2) Run `/newbot`
3) Copy the token (looks like `123456789:AA...`)
4) Paste it into `/setup`

### Discord bot token

1) Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
2) **New Application** → choose a name
3) **Bot** → **Add Bot**
4) **Enable MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** under Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents (required or the bot will crash on startup)
5) Copy the **Bot Token** and paste into `/setup`
6) Invite the bot to your server (OAuth2 URL Generator; scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`)
